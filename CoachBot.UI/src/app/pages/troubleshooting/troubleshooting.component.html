                    Changing the console variable <code>matqueuemode</code> from <strong>-1</strong> to
                    <strong>2</strong> should give you an FPS boost.Warning:
                    Your game will most likely crash when using this setting and alt-tabbing while in fullscreen
                    mode. Using (borderless) windowed mode can fix this issues. Alternatively change the variable
                    back
                    to
                    <strong>-1</strong> whenever you need to alt-tab.

                    The game can't load non-ASCII player names from the config (SDK 2007 engine limitations), so
                    make
                    sure you are not using these in any of your names in-game.
